# chatbot
a naive chatbot that sometimes misdiagnoses.

This retrieval-based prototype bot uses publicly available health information to generate indicative diagnosis and link to NHS leaflet. The result is not diagnosis and non-clinical use only.

## Requirement
Python >= 3.4 and Virtualenv >= 15.1  
or  
Docker

## Installation
### Virtualenv
Run script `./install.sh`. This will first make a virtual environment `venv` and install components within it.
### Docker (Optional)
Run `docker build -t minggli/chatbot .` to make a Docker image locally. This is not mandatory as `docker run` pulls remote image as fallback.

## Running chatbot

`export ENGINE=NLTK` (default) to use NLTK backend for traditional Bag of Words model with Naive Bayes  

`export ENGINE=TENSORFLOW` to use Tensorflow backend for representational sequence classification with Long-short Term Memroy (LSTM)

For the first time running either service, it will take longer than usual as it needs to download, process and cache web data.  

### Virtualenv
Within virtual environment `venv` (`source venv/bin/activate`), you can launch separate service:  

`python3 -m chatbot.services.ask`  

`python3 -m chatbot.services.symptoms`
### Docker
Run docker image and instantiate docker container for each service:  

`docker run -t --memory 8g --rm -p 5000:5000 -e ENGINE=$ENGINE minggli/chatbot python -m chatbot.services.ask`  

`docker run -t --memory 8g --rm -p 5001:5001 minggli/chatbot python -m chatbot.services.symptoms`  

## API endpoints
It accepts payload as simple as `{"questions": "your questions or description of symptoms"}` to below to query for indicative diagnosis:  

`POST host:5000/chatbot/api/v1/ask`  

To list all leaflets or leaflet for the chosen symptom:  

`GET host:5001/chatbot/api/v1/symptoms` or  
`GET host:5001/chatbot/api/v1/symptoms/<string:symptom_name>`

## Further development ideas
~~Using word vector rather than sparse matrix to extract semantic proximity in embedded space;~~

Explore Recurrent Neural Network (e.g. LSTM) to move from retrieval-based model to generative;

~~Explore supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation, RNN as text classification alternative to Naive Bayes.~~
